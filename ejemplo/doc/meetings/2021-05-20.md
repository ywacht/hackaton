## Q&A, Other

* Transfer canterberry/nodejs-keys into nodejs/keys [nodejs/node#456](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/456)
  * Previously discussed in the Release WG and we agreed it was good to pursue.
  * No objections to the transfer of the repository.
  * `nodejs/release-keys` preferred naming.
  * After this happens, we should update related documentation.
* Node.js releasers email alias? [#663](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/663)
  * Named alias to be more specific `security-release` to ensure itâ€™s only used for the purpose of sourcing releasers for security releases.
* Trim active releasers list [#499](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/456)
  * (Action) Richard to try and match keys to releasers.
