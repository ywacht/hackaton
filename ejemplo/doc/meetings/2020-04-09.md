* Drop backporters team - [#547](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/547)
  * We do not have clear criteria for joining the LTS team.
  * Nomination or self-nomination.
  * In the proposal LTS would take the place of the `backporters` team.

* Changelog changes - [#568](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/568)
  * Ideal if the author could write the notable change section, but unlikely to happen based on the usage of the notable change label.
  * Suggestion to create a Google doc to collaborate on notable changes. 
  * Suggestion to separate out test changes, and some doc changes to make the changelog more readable for end users.
  * Remove labels from individual commits that are not major or minor. 
  * Suggestion to add semverness to the commit message.
